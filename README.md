# CS50 Mario Exercises ðŸ§©

This repository contains solutions to **CS50 Problem Set 1 â€“ Mario**:

- `pyramid.c` â€” the **"less comfortable"** version:
  - Prints a **right-aligned pyramid** of `#` characters, based on user input height.
  - Prompts repeatedly until the user provides a positive integer (typically 1â€“8) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

- `gap.c` â€” the **"more comfortable"** version:
  - Prints **two pyramids** with a central gap (two spaces), imitating Mario jumping platforms.
  - Also re-prompts for a valid height between 1 and 8 :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
